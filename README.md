The raw data "merg-2014-emp is too big to upload here.

I use the Claude AI to help me with the code.

### Introduction
This study analyzes the determinants of hourly earnings in legal occupations (codes 2100-2160) using data from the CPS earnings dataset. Four ordinary least squares regression models with increasing complexity were developed to predict hourly earnings and evaluate the relationship between model complexity and predictive performance.
### Model Design and Variable Selection
Model 1 (Sex + Age): Includes fundamental demographic factors that typically influence earnings in professional settings.
Model 2 (+ Education): Adds grade92 (education level) to capture the significant role of formal education in legal profession earnings.
Model 3 (+ Race & Family): Incorporates race and marital status to account for potential demographic disparities and family structure effects.
Model 4 (+ More Demographics): Further includes variables for children (ownchild and chldpres) to capture the impact of family responsibilities on earnings.
